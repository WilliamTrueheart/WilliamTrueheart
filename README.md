- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WilliamTrueheart
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in UI/UX Design, riddles, and the occasional gaming session on my PC.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about TS and JS!
- ğŸ¦• I first searched 'what the heck is programming!?' in Oct. of 2021! 
- âœ¨ I've completed 5,000 Uber Eats deliveries, YOUR job oppurtunity helps me not hit 10,000.
